# Document Registry and Timestamp DApp

This Solidity DApp enables users to register document hashes on the blockchain with associated timestamps. It serves as a reliable method for proving the existence of documents at specific points in time.

## Overview

The Document Registry and Timestamp DApp is a decentralized application built using Solidity for the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely register document hashes along with relevant metadata, thereby establishing a tamper-proof record of the document's existence at a particular moment. The project combines the transparency and immutability of the blockchain with the cryptographic security of hashing algorithms to ensure the integrity and validity of the registered documents.

## Features

- Secure and transparent registration of document hashes on the Ethereum blockchain
- Timestamp association for accurate recording of document existence
- Metadata storage, including document name and description, linked to each registered document
- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the smart contract using Web3
- Integration of cryptographic hashing to provide document integrity verification

## Usage
- Connect your Ethereum wallet to the DApp by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button.
- Upload a file; the DApp will automatically generate the hash of the document.
- Provide additional details such as the document name and description.
- Click the "Add Document" button to register the document on the blockchain.
